# Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm in C

## Overview
This project provides a simple simulation of a Round Robin scheduling algorithm written in C. It is designed to demonstrate the basic principles of real-time task scheduling, where each task is given an equal amount of CPU time in a cyclic order. The implementation includes a task queue, time slicing, and a simulation of task execution based on burst times.

## Features
- Implementation of a Round Robin scheduling algorithm.
- Task management using a queue structure.
- Simulation of task execution with time slices (quantum).
- Calculation of total execution time for all tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile and run the program.

### Compiling and Running the Program
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC)
4. Run the executable
